# Rust Alphanet Multisig

This example demonstrates an integration of [BlsMultisig](../../contracts/BLSMultisig.sol) with Rust.

## Running the example

To run the example, just run the following command:

```shell
cargo run
```

This will spin up an Anvil instance in Alphanet mode, deploy the multisig contract and execute a simple operation signed by random BLS keys.
